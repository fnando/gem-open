= GemOpen

Open gems into your favorite editor by running a specific gem command.

To install it just run

  sudo gem install gem-open

Then add the following lines to your <tt>~/.bash_profile</tt> file.

  export GEM_EDITOR="mate"

Or `export GEM_EDITOR="code ."` to open directly your VSCode in a new window.

It will default to <tt>ENV["EDITOR"]</tt>, though.

Finally, run <tt>gem open GEMNAME</tt> to open that gem.

== Usage

To open the most recent version you just need to type the gem name.

  $ gem open activesupport

If you want to open a specific version you'll have to type the full name.

  $ gem open activesupport-3.0.0.beta3

== Bash completion

Want some completion? Add this snippet to your <tt>~/.bash_profile</tt> file.

  _gemopencomplete() {
      local cmd=${COMP_WORDS[0]}
      local subcmd=${COMP_WORDS[1]}
      local cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}

      case "$subcmd" in
          open)
              words=`ruby -rubygems -e 'puts Dir["{#{Gem::Specification.dirs.join(",")}}/*.gemspec"].collect {|s| File.basename(s).gsub(/\.gemspec$/, "")}'`
              ;;
          *)
              return
              ;;
      esac

      COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "$words" -- $cur))
      return 0
  }

  complete -o default -F _gemopencomplete gem
